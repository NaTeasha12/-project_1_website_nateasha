<h3>How Does Dolphins Communicate with each other?</h3>
<p> Here is a list of the following ways dophins communicate with humans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch: Bend head and tail ventrally.</li>

<li>Eyewhite display: Rolling eyes, showing the whites.</li>

<li>Flex: Bend head and tail dorsally.</li>

<li>Headwag: Rapid, side to side shaking of the head.</li>

<li>Play dead: Roll over submissively in the vicinity of another dolphin.</li>

<li>Snit: Sharp, sideways head jerk with closed or open jaws; may be accompanied by sound.</h1>
</ul>
<p>Sound travels 4.5 – 5 times faster through water than through the air. For this reason dolphins rely on sound for communication more than any other mode. Scientists believe that every bottlenose dolphin develops a distinctive high-pitched whistle, called a signature whistle (Tyack, 2000). This whistle appears to serve as a means of individual identification, much like a name. It may let the rest of the pod know which pod members are around, where they are, and, perhaps, something about their mental state. Dolphins in distress sometimes emit their signature whistles very loudly. Whistles may serve to establish or maintain vocal or physical contact between dolphins. Dolphins often respond to another dolphin’s whistle by whistling themselves or moving toward the whistler. If they become separated, a young calf and its mother whistle frequently until reunited. Dolphins also whistle when separated from other group members.
Dolphins do not always respond immediately to another dolphin whistling. Sometimes, many dolphins in the group whistle at once, repeating their signature whistles over and over. In this case, the whistling may help the dolphins keep track of each other.</p>
